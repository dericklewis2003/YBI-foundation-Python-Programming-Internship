# Programming Projects/Tasks - YBI Foundation Internship

During my internship at YBI Foundation, I worked on several programming projects that contributed to enhancing my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Below are the detailed descriptions of the tasks and projects undertaken:

## 1. **Wine Quality Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **Objective**: To build a machine learning model to predict the quality of red and white wines based on various chemical properties.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Tasks Involved**:
     - Data acquisition and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the wine quality dataset
     - Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict wine quality
     - Model evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
     - Fine-tuning hyperparameters and cross-validation for better model performance
   - **Outcome**: Achieved a model accuracy of over 60% for red wine and 56% for white wine, with insights into the chemical properties influencing wine quality.

## 2. **Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning**
   - **Objective**: To build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing preferences and history.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
   - **Tasks Involved**:
     - Data acquisition and preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in user preferences and movie metadata
     - Building a collaborative filtering and content-based filtering recommendation model
     - Model evaluation using precision, recall, and mean squared error (MSE)
     - Fine-tuning model parameters to improve recommendation accuracy
   - **Outcome**: Developed a movie recommendation system that suggests personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing behavior.

## 3. **Financial Market News Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning**
   - **Objective**: To analyze the sentiment of financial news articles and predict its impact on the market using a Random Forest model.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
   - **Tasks Involved**:
     - Data acquisition and preprocessing (handling missing values, text cleaning)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sentiment distribution
     - Training a Random Forest classifier to predict sentiment from news articles
     - Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
     - Making predictions on new news articles to gauge their sentiment and potential market impact
   - **Outcome**: Developed a sentiment analysis model that classifies financial news as positive or negative, providing insights into how news may influence market movements.
