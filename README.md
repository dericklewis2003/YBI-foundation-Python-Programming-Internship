# Programming Projects/Tasks - YBI Foundation Internship

During my internship at YBI Foundation, I worked on several programming projects that contributed to enhancing my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Below are the detailed descriptions of the tasks and projects undertaken:

## 1. **Wine Quality Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **Objective**: To build a machine learning model to predict the quality of red and white wines based on various chemical properties.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Tasks Involved**:
     - Data acquisition and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the wine quality dataset
     - Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict wine quality
     - Model evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
     - Fine-tuning hyperparameters and cross-validation for better model performance
   - **Outcome**: Achieved a model accuracy of over 60% for red wine and 56% for white wine, with insights into the chemical properties influencing wine quality.
